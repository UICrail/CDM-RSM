Folder for GRAPHOL file(s).

GRAPHOL is a graphic language for representing OWL2 ontologies. GRAPHOL can be edited using EDDY (version 3.7.1 at present).

Available files are:

| File name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| ...RSM_topology | Semantic RSM topology module |
| ...geosparql_adapter | Interfaces for using GeoSPARQL Feature, Geometry, and property specialization |
| ...RSM_localisation | Semantic RSM localisation module (position of things on the topology) |
| ...IFC_adapter | adapter between RSM topo and loca, and IFC |
| ...List_modified | attempt to represent the existing List ontology (by Pauwels and Terkaj) in GRAPHOL. The result is slightly different, although logically equivalent. The original List ontology is still used (as of January 2026 - check for changes). |
